Hello Everyone, 

I decided to write up an unofficial guide to noble etiquette based entirely off what is known etiquette in feudal society and the game of thrones Lore. Firstly this is designed to assist players who are new to game of thrones and or medieval roleplay as knowing how to address nobles, royals etc... can get a bit confusing however nobles are likely to be highly offended if mislabeled or addressed incorrectly. Nearly all nobles when they are children are taught how to address other nobles, royals and members of the gentry.

For this purpose I'll be showing you how to address nobles starting from the highest of nobility on down. So, here we go.

[b]Monarchs[/b] - Kings/Queens
[b]Formal:[/b] Your Grace
[b]Semi Formal:[/b] Your Majesty
[b]Casual:[/b] King (Last Name) / My King/Queen (Only applies if they are [u]YOUR[/u] King/Queen i.e. you owe them pledges of service and fealty.
[b]Personal:[/b] (First Name)

So to touch on this more specifically this form of address in Game of Thrones pertains directly to a sitting monarch, and what is meant by a sitting monarch is the ruling individual of a kingdom. For example King Aegon Targaryen is the current sitting monarch of the Crownlands. This differs from Daenerys Targaryen, Blossom Whent and Sansa Targaryen who are effectually the Queen and consorts to the King (Sitting Monarch). They aren't considered to be the sitting monarch but rather married "to" the sitting Monarch. They hold the titles of Queen since the title is seen inferior to the King, however if a Queen is the sitting monarch her husband is referred to as the Prince Consort as to symbolize his status below the sitting Queen.

------------------------------------------------------------

Royal Consorts - Prince Consort/Queen
[b]Formal:[/b] Your Royal Highness
[b]Semi Formal:[/b] Your Highness
[b]Casual:[/b] My Prince/Queen OR My Prince/Queen OR Prince (First Name)/Queen (First name)
[b]Personal:[/b] (First Name)

Side Note: You might wonder why you can't call a Queen Consort or Prince Consort , Your Majesty. It falls within the definition of the word Majesty which is defined below.
[i]noun[/i]
1. impressive stateliness, dignity, or beauty.i.e. "experience the majesty of the Rockies"

2. royal power. i.e. "the majesty of the royal household"

When addressing someone as "Your Majesty" you are acknowledging they hold the royal power in their household, they are the supreme authority militarily, diplomatically and administratively within their respective Kingdom. While the Queen Consort or the Prince Consort may have authority it is authority derived from the sitting Monarch, not themselves.

Next we will discuss the children of sitting Monarchs and or those declared to be heirs to a royal throne, or those honorifically granted the royal title of Prince or Princess.

------------------------------------------------------------

Princes and Princesses
[b]Formal:[/b] Your Royal Highness or (if provided honorifically) Your Highness
[b]Semi Formal:[/b] Your Highness
[b]Casual:[/b] My Prince/Princess OR Prince (First Name)/Princess (First name)
[b]Personal:[/b] (First Name)

Now at this point you might be asking your self, why do we call them by their first names and not the last name? The last name when provided after a title indicates they are the head of household or in the very least married to the head of household. To address someone as Prince (Last Name) is stating they are the head of their household and represent it as the leader in your eyes, they can offend the noble sensibilities of both the prince you are addressing and anyone who owes loyalty to the King. The only time this would be an appropriate form of address is to address a Prince or Princess who is set to be crowned but have not yet had their coronation, you are acknowledging them as Prince or Princess (Last Name) the head of their household just not yet titled King or Queen. 

Next we will be covering the next tier below royalty in the Game of Thrones, which is the members of the small council.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Lords and Ladies
[b]Formal:[/b] Your Lordship
[b]Semi Formal:[/b] Lord (Last Last [If head of household]), Lord (First Name [If NOT head of household])
[b]Casual:[/b] My Lord
[b]Personal:[/b] (First Name)

Lords are similarly addressed like Kings in regards to the first name and last names being used, however the dynamic changes in terms of who can be called a Lord or not. The points of who can be called Lord or not can become confusing even to the most experienced of Lords. So we'll go by the definition of what is provided in the Game of Thrones lore. 
[QUOTE]"Lord is a title given to a person who controls authority. It is most commonly referred to as a title of nobility in the Seven Kingdoms. The title of lord may also be given as a courtesy to small council members and others in a position of power or influence, an honorific usage distinct from the grant of the rank of lordship, which is typically assumed to be accompanied by a grant of lands or a castle. One may also be legally raised to the style of "lord" without also receiving lands, but such a lordship is effectively an empty honor."[/QUOTE]

With that said Lords are defined as people who are given a tract of land to which they are also provided the authority to govern and serve the King's Justice. Landed knights who are usually given a tower, or keep are not Lords. For example Ser Gregor Clegane is not a lord despite being the head of his own house, having land and a keep under his family he is considered a "Landed Knight" while he is authorized to collect the rents and taxes from that land he cannot dispense the King's Justice and must instead get the lord under whom presides over his land to represent the King's justice. While many landed knight may simply handle the issue personally it doesn't change the fact that they are not "authorized" to dispense the King's justice.  Next we will be talking about Knights!

------------------------------------------------------------

Knights
[b]Formal:[/b] Ser (First Name)
[b]Semi Formal:[/b] Ser
[b]Casual:[/b] (Same as Semi Formal)
[b]Personal:[/b] (First Name)

So, knighthood is a bit of tricky business in Westeros, it is tied directly to the Faith of the Seven  and the feudal  culture of Westeros. It is a title shared mainly by those who a part of the religion of the Seven and is why there aren't many knights in the North due to the lack of faith in the Seven and more faith towards the Old Gods.  It can be beast said by the Game of Thrones Lore;
[QUOTE]Any man can be knighted, no matter their birth. Social pressure keeps knighthood from being exploited by unscrupulous knights who might give the accolade for money. Knighthood is seen as primarily a martial position, so even the sons of powerful lords are not necessarily knighted if they are incapable of fulfilling the requirements. Doing otherwise would lose honor rather than gain it, and would make a lord and his family be held up to ridicule. Regardless, at times, a lord's son is knighted without fulfilling the requirements. Further, a young knight's repute partially derives from the honor of the man who conferred knighthood on him. Receiving your knighthood from a king, prince, Kingsguard knight, or legendary knight holds great prestige.[/QUOTE]
Women cannot be knighted not matter their skill as a warrior, this however can be dubiously  overruled by a King whom may knight whomever they please by their own right to rule.[/QUOTE]
