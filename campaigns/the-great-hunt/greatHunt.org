* The Story

** Session One
   Snow fell as the young man pulled his cloak around himself. Kilshire lay in
   flames. /'How many more times do those damned Norsemen have to raid us?'/,
   the man thought as he shivered. /'And yet the winter is almost here - what
   are we to do to survive the raids as well?'/

   Byrhtric frowned as he rode towards Ceolwulf. So much damage to the village, he
   thought as he dismounted.
   
   The spearman knelt down, keeping his dagger close as the lord approached him.
   A soft sigh left Ceolwulf. *"We can't keep letting these raids happening -
   they steal our supplies and kill our troops and take our food -"*

   *"I know,"* the young lord replied after his husband caught his breath. *"I
   have heard rumors, though - a great stag, white as snow, has supposedly been
   running around in the area. If we managed to bring it back for the people,
   there would certainly be more than enough food to eat."
 
   *"Then that settles it. I will hunt down this stag before the winter, and I
   will bring it back so the village can survive."*
  
   Swear an Iron Vow: [1d6+1] -> (4) +1 = 5

       /-weak hit: +1 progress, but unsure what to do/

   Challenge Die One: [1d10] -> = 5

   Challenge Die Two: [1d10] -> = 2

   /Which way would I need to go? 1-25 = North, 26-50 = South, 51-75 = West,
   76-100 = East/ 

   [1d100] -> = 67 West
