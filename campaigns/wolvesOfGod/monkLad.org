 third of your wealth in successfully upholding the desperate or aiding those who have no power to repay you or profit you in fit measure to your labors.
***** Shames
      1. Suffer Shame if you strike a human being with intent to harm them.
      2. Suffer Shame if you lie, steal, disobey your clerical superior, honor false gods, dishonor the Sabbath, bear weapons, wear war-harness, or otherwise knowingly break the laws of the Church.
      3. Suffer Shame if you willingly wield a heathen magical object or choose to receive a Galdormanâ€™s spells, for you must shun the use of all magic. Saints suffer especially from Shameful acts, for they always are inflicted
